  <h2 align="center"><font color="#00DAD4">1970 Pontiac GTO(dream car)</font></h2>
  <img src="images/gto.jpg" alt="GTO" style="width:500px;height:300px;" class="center" border="5">

  <p align="center"><font size="5" color="white">The 1970 GTO had an attractive restyled front-end treatment that had a quad headlight design now separate from the dual front grilles and embedded into the Endura front bumper. This was a great styling touch along with the new fender creases found on the top of each wheel well and the revised rear bumper and taillight design.</font></p>

  <h2 align="center"><font color="#00DAD4">1970 Dodge Super Bee</font></h2>
  <img src="images/superbee.jpg" alt="GTO" style="width:500px;height:300px;" class="center" border="5">
  <p align="center"><font size="5" color="white">The original Dodge Super Bee was based on the Dodge Coronet two-door coupe, and was produced from 1968 until 1970. It was Dodge's low-priced powerful muscle car and a rebadged version of the Plymouth Road Runner. The origin of the name, "Super Bee", has its basis in the "B" Body designation pertinent to Chrysler's mid-sized cars, including the Road Runner and Charger.</font></p>

  <h2 align="center"><font color="#00DAD4">2000 Mazda Rx-7</font></h2>
  <img src="images/rx7.jpg" alt="GTO" style="width:500px;height:300px;" class="center" border="5">
  <p align="center"><font size="5" color="white">The Mazda RX-7 is a front/mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive rotary engine powered sports car that was manufactured and marketed by Mazda from 1978 to 2002 across three generations, all of which made use of a compact, lightweight Wankel rotary engine. The first generation of the RX-7, SA and FB, was a two-seater coup√©.</font></p>

  <h2 align="center"><font color="#00DAD4">1979 Ford F250</font></h2>
  <img src="images/f2501979.jpg" alt="GTO" style="width:500px;height:300px;" class="center" border="5">
  <p align="center"><font size="5" color="white">In 1978, the 351 Cleveland V-8 replaced the 302 Cleveland V8 in the F-250 and F-350. The 302 Cleveland continued alongside the 351 Cleveland in the F-100. The 4.1 litre inline 6 cylinder continued to be sold across the range. In 1979, the 302 Cleveland was discontinued, leaving the standard engine as the 4.1 litre Straight-6, with the 351 Cleveland (badged as the 5.8), as the only upgrade, except the F-100 4x4's which was only available with the 5.8 litre V8. The F-250 and F-350 had an automatic gearbox as an option for the first time in Australia, though still only on the V8 engine.</font></p>
